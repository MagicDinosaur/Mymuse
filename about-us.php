<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hi. My name is Duc, a junior CS student at GSU. Welcome to my project - MyMuse.
     You can use it to relax (or not, well, I made the game a bit hard), watching the cute cats that I have been collected, and compete with others. 
    This web app still have severals bugs but I hope you can tolerate them and enjoy the game :)
</p>  
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    The game is a simple game that you need to follow the pattern to gain a score. 
    The pattern is a series of notes, each note is a different images and sounds. 
    The game will start with a random pattern, and you need to repeat it to gain a score. 
    The score will be saved and displayed in the <strong>"Account tab."</strong> To do so, you first need to create an 
    account. If you already have an account, you can login in <strong>"Log In."</strong> tab.
    <br>
    
I want to make a website that can showcase programming and logic skills, and have the opportunity to expand in the future . Therefore, a webgame is a suitable choice. hehe. I aslo want to show a bit about my personality. Shy, chill, and calm. 
<h3>Technology</h3>
<b>Check list</b>
<ul>
  <li><b><i>Database Usage</i></b>: MySQL for manage user's accounts and scores. You can login, save score, view score, or register new account <a href ="login.php" style ="color:inherit">.Try in hereüêæ</a> </li>
  <li><b><i>Ajax usage</i></b>: For handling sending score task (your score will be sent to database if you lose and the game over)<a href ="login.php" style ="color:inherit">.<b> Login</b> and check "Account" tab to try itüêæ</a> </li>
  <li><b><i>Theme</i></b>: Yes! the theme is consistent. Is it cute <3? </li>
  <li><b><i>New Library Usage</i></b>: I used boostrap for table rendering, AudioContext for button sound and image-to-base64 to convert avatar to base64. </li>
  <li><b><i>Javascript Usage</i></b>: Yes. JS is everywhere on this website</li>
  <li><b><i>Membership Area</i></b>: Yes. You can create an account and login in the "Log In" tab</li>
  <li><b><i>General User</i></b>: You can play with this game without creating an account</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Basically, I used HTML5, CSS, PHP 8.1.7, MySQL 5, Ajax, Boostrap 4.0, JS 3.6, and Jquery 3.6  to develope this game.
    The chalenges I faced are come from tricky tasks such as: handling the game timer logic, display the information, ranking, and the security of the website.
    You might need to check the suitable version of languagues if you want to try to run the code (which i would love you if you don't) to see how it works.
    <br>
    In the future, I might add some feature to this game, such as: <br>
    - Add "Forgot password" function<br>
    - Allow user to modify their information<br>
    - Enhance user experience tab<br>
    - Allow user to modify the difficulty<br>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    Beside the scope of the project, where i have chance to sharpen my technical skills <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>, during this course I have learned alot about softskills that necessary for my careers, 
    job searching. Also thanks to this course and the wonderful teacher - Dr.Robert, I have opportunity to expand my network circles, with the ones who have the same interest as me. <br>
    Thank you for reading! <br>
